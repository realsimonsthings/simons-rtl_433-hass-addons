## [1.0.0] - 2024-07-17

* First version from Simon. No functional changes. Just added addition flags from auto-discovery script to addon config.

## [0.8.2] - 2024-06-23

* Upgrade base images to support RTL-SDR V4 #181

## [0.8.1] - 2024-02-17

* Downgrade paho-mqtt to 1.6.3 as 2.x has compatibility breaks. #178 #179

## [0.8.0] - 2024-02-16

* Update to rtl_433 23.11 for the stable addon
  * The new release will properly support `device_topic_suffix` in the stable branch of this addon #173
* Default `retain` to true. The recommended approach to running the addon is to only run discovery when actually trying to add a device.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-10-27

* `device_topic_suffix` support added by @unverbraucht #144
* Fix pointing the next version of the addon to the stable version #164

## [0.6.0] - 2023-02-08

* Update rtl_433 to the 22.11 release.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-10-25

* Upgrade rtl_433 to the latest master #117 #119
* Update patch for "Update mqtt hass to include triggers #2102"
  * **Breaking Change:** This removes device automation support for **code, unit, and tristate** fields as the upstream maintainers indicated there is no good way to know how these fields should be configured. Existing configurations set to retain will be kept. To configure these fields in the future, manually publish a configuration topic that matches your sensor.
  * `time` and `battery_ok` sensors are now set as diagnostic sensors in Home Assistant.
  * `time` sensors are disabled by default.
  * `channel` and `button` sensors trigger button device automations.
  * Honeywell Doorbells now support triggering knocks (1 push) and secret knocks (3 pushes) as device automations.

**READ BEFORE UPDATING**

The addon now uses a prebuilt image instead of being built locally when installed. This significantly speeds up installation times for slower devices, and ensures everyone is using the same code. Unfortunately, Home Assistant can't switch these installation methods automatically. To upgrade, **uninstall and reinstall the addon**. This will lose settings set in the Configuration section including custom-set MQTT hosts and credentials. Save them aside before reinstalling.
